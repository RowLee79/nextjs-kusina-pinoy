# Kusina Pinoy — Filipino Food Online Ordering

A Next.js storefront and kitchen operations demo backed by Cloudflare D1. Includes eight Filipino sample dishes, category filtering, shopping cart, delivery or pickup checkout, server-side price calculation, order tracking by reference and phone, a kitchen status board, and menu availability management. Prices are PHP stored as integer centavos.

Portfolio demonstration by RowLee Tanawan. The implementation uses Next.js-compatible App Router APIs with the Vinext runtime; deployment targets Cloudflare Workers. It is not a conventional standalone `next dev` deployment.

## Features

See the implemented workflows in [setup and project documentation](docs/SETUP.md).

## Technology

React, TypeScript, Next.js-compatible App Router, Vinext, Vite and responsive CSS. Cloudflare D1 SQLite and Drizzle migrations provide persistent data.

## Run locally

Node.js 22.13+ is required. Follow [installation, database initialization and walkthrough instructions](docs/SETUP.md), including the project-specific migration command. Dependencies and local database files are excluded from source control.
